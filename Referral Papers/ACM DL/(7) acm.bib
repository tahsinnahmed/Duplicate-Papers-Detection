abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting deception using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for few-shot learning in domain-agnostic settings. Our approach combines the sophisticated reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base of LLMs to identify deceptive statements across various contexts, with a focus on the explainability of the detection process. This emphasis on explainability enables a detailed analysis of the model's methodologies in distinguishing between truthful and deceptive statements. Additionally, we examine the impact of different definitions of deception, from overt falsehoods to subtle misrepresentations, on the model's accuracy. Our main contributions include providing initial insights into the adaptability of LLMs for deception detection and highlighting the challenges faced in this endeavor, thereby encouraging further exploration in this area.},

abstract = {Email Phishing is one of the most pervasive social-engineering attack that targets user credentials and personal information. Current defenses often rely on pattern-based rules or signatures to detect phishing emails. These rules have been prone to changes in the content of the email body as they cannot comprehend the semantics of the message. Cybercriminals are using modern generative AI tools to craft phishing messages that can evade current defenses. In this paper, we present PhishEmailLLM a novel system that relies on publicly available LLMs and advanced ML models to accurately detect phishing emails. We highlight the challenges to creating and use such systems and present our solution to overcome these challenges using modern software and cloud architectures. A thorough evaluation of our system was conducted using publicly available high-quality phishing datasets. We evaluated several top of the line freely available LLMs and compared our system to well-known baseline systems for Phishing detection. We established that our meta-hybrid approach, using LLMs and traditional ML algorithms for phishing detection, outperforms other systems and costs less to run.},

abstract = {Imbalanced data classification has always been one of the most challenging problems in data science especially in the cybersecurity field, where we observe an out-of-balance proportion between benign and phishing examples in security datasets. Even though there are many phishing detection methods in literature, most of them neglect the imbalanced nature of phishing email datasets. In this paper, we examine the imbalanced property by varying legitimate to phishing class ratios. We generate new synthetic instances using a generative adversarial network model for long sentences (LeakGAN) to balance out the training process and ameliorate its impact on classification. These synthetic instances are labeled by positive-unlabeled learning and added to the initial imbalanced training set. The resulting dataset is given to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for sequence classification. We compare several state-of-the-art methods from the literature against our approach, which achieves a high performance throughout all the imbalanced ratios reaching an F1-score of 99.6\% for the most extreme imbalanced ratio and an F1-score of 99.8\% for balanced cases.},

abstract = {Phishing emails often disguise a link's actual URL. Thus, common anti-phishing advice is to check a link's URL before clicking, but email clients do not support this well. Automated phishing detection enables email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for phishing warning design.},

abstract = {Domain squatting is a technique used by attackers to create domain names for phishing sites. In recent phishing attempts, we have observed many domain names that use multiple techniques to evade existing methods for domain squatting. These domain names, which we call generated squatting domains (GSDs), are quite different in appearance from legitimate domain names and do not contain brand names, making them difficult to associate with phishing. In this paper, we propose a system called PhishReplicant that detects GSDs by focusing on the linguistic similarity of domain names. We analyzed newly registered and observed domain names extracted from certificate transparency logs, passive DNS, and DNS zone files. We detected 3,498 domain names acquired by attackers in a four-week experiment, of which 2,821 were used for phishing sites within a month of detection. We also confirmed that our proposed system outperformed existing systems in both detection accuracy and number of domain names detected. As an in-depth analysis, we examined 205k GSDs collected over 150 days and found that phishing using GSDs was distributed globally. However, attackers intensively targeted brands in specific regions and industries. By analyzing GSDs in real time, we can block phishing sites before or immediately after they appear.},

abstract = {The surge in merchant fraud poses a significant threat to market order and consumer security. Effective security monitoring for merchants is crucial in safeguarding the digital life ecosystem and users' financial well-being. Detecting daily fraudulent payment transactions, a challenging task for current methods, requires efficient transformation of transactions into embeddings, especially in representing merchants based on their behavioral transactions. To address this, we propose the Grouping Sampling-based Sequence Generation (GSSG) method to generate meaningful sequences, enabling interactions among correlated transactions. We introduce Hierarchical Embedding Learning (HEL) and Hierarchical Masking pre-training (HMP) for the effective representation of hierarchical structures within flat transaction sequences. Pretrained on WeChat Pay data, our model, PTP, demonstrates superior performance in downstream fraud transaction detection, especially in few-shot learning scenarios, showcasing great potential in payment transaction scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the prevalent issue of account takeover (ATO) fraud, which significantly impacts businesses through stolen user information. Websites have adopted risk-based authentication, incorporating browser fingerprinting techniques to counteract this threat. However, attackers have adapted by using anti-detect browsers, referred to as fraud browsers, to spoof user information effectively. While traditional fingerprinting methods are capable of identifying fraud browsers, they encounter scalability and performance challenges in risk-based systems. To address these issues, we developed Browser Polygraph, an ML-based tool that applies coarse-grained privacy-preserving fingerprints to assess browser authenticity and assigns risk factors to suspicious sessions. Coarse-grained fingerprints, by design, cannot be used for user tracking but only for fraud detection purposes. Deployed at a major financial company, Browser Polygraph has flagged suspicious sessions, enabling more targeted identification of potential fraud, thus enhancing the company's ability to tackle ATO attempts.},

abstract = {Why do "classical" attacks such as phishing, IRS scams, etc., still succeed? How do attackers increase their chances of success? How do people reason about scams and frauds they face daily? More research is needed on these questions, which is the focus of this paper. We take a well-known attack, viz. company representative fraud, and study several parameters that bear on its effectiveness with a between-subjects study. We also study the effectiveness of a coherent language generation technique in producing phishing emails. We give ample room for the participants to demonstrate their reasoning and strategies.Unfortunately, our experiment indicates that participants are inadequately prepared for dealing with even the company representative fraud. Participants also could not differentiate between offers written by human or generated semi-automatically. Moreover, our results show attackers can easily increase their success rate by adding some basic information about the sender, so defenders should focus more on such attacks. We also observed that participants who paid attention to more clues were better in distinguishing legitimate messages from phishing, hence training regimes should check for reasoning strategies, not just who did not click on a link or download an attachment. Thus, insights from our work can help defenders in developing better strategies to evaluate their defenses and also in devising more effective training strategies.},
