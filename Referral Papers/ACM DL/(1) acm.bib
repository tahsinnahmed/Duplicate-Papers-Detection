abstract = {Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated and increasingly prevalent form of cyber fraud that targets businesses and individuals to gain financial benefits and access sensitive data. BEC fraud involves various strategies such as impersonation, account compromise, and social engineering, making them challenging to detect and prevent. Despite numerous solutions developed to combat BEC, the threat continues to evolve. In this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of BEC, categorising its various forms, detection techniques, and countermeasures. The proposed taxonomy seeks to deepen the comprehension of BEC fraud and establish a comprehensive framework for advancing research and practical applications, facilitating the development of more effective defence mechanisms against BEC fraud.},

Our approach combines the sophisticated reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base of LLMs to identify deceptive statements across various contexts, with a focus on the explainability of the detection process. This emphasis on explainability enables a detailed analysis of the model's methodologies in distinguishing between truthful and deceptive statements. Additionally, we examine the impact of different definitions of deception, from overt falsehoods to subtle misrepresentations, on the model's accuracy. Our main contributions include providing initial insights into the adaptability of LLMs for deception detection and highlighting the challenges faced in this endeavor, thereby encouraging further exploration in this area.},

abstract = {Email Phishing is one of the most pervasive social-engineering attack that targets user credentials and personal information. Current defenses often rely on pattern-based rules or signatures to detect phishing emails. These rules have been prone to changes in the content of the email body as they cannot comprehend the semantics of the message. Cybercriminals are using modern generative AI tools to craft phishing messages that can evade current defenses. In this paper, we present PhishEmailLLM a novel system that relies on publicly available LLMs and advanced ML models to accurately detect phishing emails. We highlight the challenges to creating and use such systems and present our solution to overcome these challenges using modern software and cloud architectures. A thorough evaluation of our system was conducted using publicly available high-quality phishing datasets. We evaluated several top of the line freely available LLMs and compared our system to well-known baseline systems for Phishing detection. We established that our meta-hybrid approach, using LLMs and traditional ML algorithms for phishing detection, outperforms other systems and costs less to run.},

Phishing is the most common type of social engineering. In phishing, an attacker poses as a trustworthy source in an attempt to have the victim release personal or private information. Spear phishing is a popular type of phishing attack where the attacker provides information retaining to a select few targets rather than generic information for a mass amount of targets. This paper provides an overview of social engineering attacks, the detection methods of social engineering and phishing attacks, the education and training techniques for preventing social engineering and phishing attacks, as well as the susceptibility of users to social engineering and phishing attacks.},

Alongside this fact, people have been victims of scams involving these online services. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze reports of online banking scams reported on social media using content analysis. The 26 filtered posts are labeled with 27 codes generated, and the top six were discussed. Specifically, scam (88.46\%) was the most common code, followed by phone calls (57.69\%) and impersonation (53.84\%). Benefits, verifying personal information, and social engineering all had 46.15\% occurrences. It is recommended for potential online banking scams to verify with the bank before giving away information, and to raise awareness on the possible technique's scammers use.},

abstract = {Phishing has become one of the major security threats to Web users, and has caused more financial and privacy loss each year. Nowadays, most anti-phishing research focuses on phishing detection, the technical side while ignoring the other side, the users. Since the Internet is in fact the interaction between people and the network, to comprehensively combat phishing, the anti-phishing training of Web users should be strengthened. This paper analyzes some representative works on why people get phished and anti-phishing training methods, learns some education and psychology theories, studies recent phishing statistics reports, and then proposes several design principles, so that a solid foundation is laid for the design of the training method, including training contents, content arrangement, and training form. Then an online interactive training tool is designed, which covers three phishing forms— phishing websites, messages, and emails. To evaluate the effectiveness of the training method, we organized volunteers to actually participate in the training, and carried out pre- and post-tests to evaluate the training method. The proposed method is proved practical and statistically effective through the paired samples t-test analysis.},

abstract = {Why do "classical" attacks such as phishing, IRS scams, etc., still succeed? How do attackers increase their chances of success? How do people reason about scams and frauds they face daily? More research is needed on these questions, which is the focus of this paper. We take a well-known attack, viz. company representative fraud, and study several parameters that bear on its effectiveness with a between-subjects study. We also study the effectiveness of a coherent language generation technique in producing phishing emails. We give ample room for the participants to demonstrate their reasoning and strategies.Unfortunately, our experiment indicates that participants are inadequately prepared for dealing with even the company representative fraud. Participants also could not differentiate between offers written by human or generated semi-automatically. Moreover, our results show attackers can easily increase their success rate by adding some basic information about the sender, so defenders should focus more on such attacks. We also observed that participants who paid attention to more clues were better in distinguishing legitimate messages from phishing, hence training regimes should check for reasoning strategies, not just who did not click on a link or download an attachment. Thus, insights from our work can help defenders in developing better strategies to evaluate their defenses and also in devising more effective training strategies.},

abstract = {Imbalanced data classification has always been one of the most challenging problems in data science especially in the cybersecurity field, where we observe an out-of-balance proportion between benign and phishing examples in security datasets. Even though there are many phishing detection methods in literature, most of them neglect the imbalanced nature of phishing email datasets. In this paper, we examine the imbalanced property by varying legitimate to phishing class ratios. We generate new synthetic instances using a generative adversarial network model for long sentences (LeakGAN) to balance out the training process and ameliorate its impact on classification. These synthetic instances are labeled by positive-unlabeled learning and added to the initial imbalanced training set. The resulting dataset is given to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for sequence classification. We compare several state-of-the-art methods from the literature against our approach, which achieves a high performance throughout all the imbalanced ratios reaching an F1-score of 99.6\% for the most extreme imbalanced ratio and an F1-score of 99.8\% for balanced cases.},

abstract = {Technology has grown rapidly since the end of the last century. Thousands of businesses from different major industries are transforming into information organizations and offering online services. The industrial and enterprise of Internet of Things (IoT) is growing at an exponential rate. Incident Command Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), which were once known to be untouchable by malware as they were usually available offline, are now facing security challenges. These systems become more vulnerable as their online availability increases to enable integration with other systems. Technology allows organizations to provide greater value to customers, expand their businesses beyond physical boundaries, and compete with other businesses. However, technology also allows attackers from all over the world to attack organizations and consumers. Ransomware, a type of malware, is a growing cybersecurity threat. It mainly targets home users and businesses for financial gain. Ransomware attacks often start with a delivery phase in which attackers deliver malicious content. Attackers often use multiple threat vectors for ransomware enablement such as emails, instant messages, and drive-by downloads, exploiting the vulnerabilities of a network or application. Among these attack vectors, email is the top threat vector, which most ransomware attackers attempt to use. This study proposes the use of a phishing detector application, PhAttApp. This application offers numerous features to detect and prevent ransomware delivery through phishing channels and thus reduces the risk of ransomware infection.},

abstract = {Domain squatting is a technique used by attackers to create domain names for phishing sites. In recent phishing attempts, we have observed many domain names that use multiple techniques to evade existing methods for domain squatting. These domain names, which we call generated squatting domains (GSDs), are quite different in appearance from legitimate domain names and do not contain brand names, making them difficult to associate with phishing. In this paper, we propose a system called PhishReplicant that detects GSDs by focusing on the linguistic similarity of domain names. We analyzed newly registered and observed domain names extracted from certificate transparency logs, passive DNS, and DNS zone files. We detected 3,498 domain names acquired by attackers in a four-week experiment, of which 2,821 were used for phishing sites within a month of detection. We also confirmed that our proposed system outperformed existing systems in both detection accuracy and number of domain names detected. As an in-depth analysis, we examined 205k GSDs collected over 150 days and found that phishing using GSDs was distributed globally. However, attackers intensively targeted brands in specific regions and industries. By analyzing GSDs in real time, we can block phishing sites before or immediately after they appear.},

abstract = {Phishing emails often disguise a link's actual URL. Thus, common anti-phishing advice is to check a link's URL before clicking, but email clients do not support this well. Automated phishing detection enables email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for phishing warning design.},

abstract = {Impersonation tactics, such as app squatting and app cloning, have posed longstanding challenges in the mobile app industry, where malicious actors exploit the names and reputations of popular apps to deceive users. With the rapid growth of large language model (LLM) stores like GPT Store and FlowGPT, these issues have similarly surfaced, highlighting the urgent need for robust industry standards and automated detection mechanisms to safeguard the LLM app ecosystem and protect users from fraudulent practices. In this study, we present the first large-scale analysis of LLM app squatting and cloning using our custom-built tool, LLMappCrazy. LLMappCrazy covers 14 squatting generation techniques and integrates Levenshtein distance and BERT-based semantic analysis to detect cloning by analyzing app functional similarities. Using this tool, we generated variations of the top 1000 app names and found over 5,000 squatting LLM apps in the dataset. Additionally, we observed 13,325 cloning cases across six major platforms. After sampling, we find that 4.7\% of the squatting apps and 18.4\% of the cloning apps exhibited malicious behavior, including phishing, malware distribution, fake content dissemination, and aggressive ad injection. Our work provides actionable insights for industry stakeholders to address these growing threats and foster a safer, more trustworthy LLM app ecosystem.},

Within that framing, we describe the most salient concerns for CISOs, isolate key decision-making factors they use when prioritizing security investments, and surface practical complexities and pain points that they face in executing their strategy. Our results surface opportunities to help CISOs better navigate the complex task of managing organizational risk, as well as lessons for how security tools can be made more deployable in practice.},

They publish various marketing promises on their websites to their customers -- organizations of all sizes. This paper investigates how these promises align with customers' needs, how they relate to human-centered security challenges highlighted in prior research, and what narrative is presented regarding the role of employees (as SAT recipients). We also investigate the level of transparency in vendor promises, as to whether it constitutes an information asymmetry. We gathered search terms from n=30 awareness professionals to perform an automated Google search and scraping of SAT vendors' websites. We then performed a thematic analysis of 2,476 statements on 156 websites from 59 vendors. We found that the messaging from SAT vendors precisely targets customers' need for easy-to-implement and compliance-fulfilling SAT products; how SAT products are offered also means that some of the impacts of SAT go unmentioned and are transferred to the customer, such as user support. In this vendor-customer relationship, employees are portrayed as a source of weaknesses, needing an indefinite amount of training to be incorporated into the organization's protection. We conclude with suggestions for SAT vendors and regulators, notably toward an SAT ecosystem that directly links SAT solutions to usable security technologies within the organization environment.},

abstract = {The intensity and sophistication of cyberattacks have informed the need for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for cyber security risk management (CSRM). We have studied the impact of using AI for CSRM in Telecommunication Industry 4.0 (TI4.0). This case study is used to develop an AI-enabled approach for enhanced protection of TI4.0. The services and the infrastructure provided by the TI4.0 are characterized by complexities due to the rapid evolution of associated technologies. This has continued to increase the attack surface and expose the industry to more cyber security risks. This article shows how the use of AI impacts CSRM in the TI4.0. Our work provides insights into the application of AI in mitigating cyber security risks. We have found that AI can enhance CSRM and, its effectiveness is determined by the quality of data that it was trained with; the training it received as well as the security of the AI solution.},

abstract = {Single Sign-On (SSO) has been widely adopted for online authentication due to its favorable usability and security. However, it also introduces a single point of failure since all service providers fully trust the identity of a user created by the SSO identity provider. In this paper, we investigate the identity-account inconsistency threat, a new SSO vulnerability that can cause the compromise of online accounts. The vulnerability exists because current SSO systems highly rely on a user’s email address to bind an account with a real identity, but ignore the fact that email addresses might be reused by other users. We reveal that under the SSO authentication, such inconsistency allows an adversary controlling a reused email address to take over associated online accounts without knowing any credentials like passwords. Specifically, we first conduct a measurement study on the account management policies for multiple cloud email providers, showing the feasibility of acquiring previously used email accounts. We further perform a systematic study on 100 popular websites using the Google business email service with our own domain address and demonstrate that most online accounts can be compromised by exploiting this inconsistency vulnerability. To shed light on email reuse in the wild, we analyze the commonly used naming conventions that lead to a wide existence of potential email address collisions, and conduct a case study on the account policies of U.S. universities. Finally, we propose several useful practices for end-users, service providers, and identity providers to protect against this identity-account inconsistency threat.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

Effective security monitoring for merchants is crucial in safeguarding the digital life ecosystem and users' financial well-being. Detecting daily fraudulent payment transactions, a challenging task for current methods, requires efficient transformation of transactions into embeddings, especially in representing merchants based on their behavioral transactions. To address this, we propose the Grouping Sampling-based Sequence Generation (GSSG) method to generate meaningful sequences, enabling interactions among correlated transactions. We introduce Hierarchical Embedding Learning (HEL) and Hierarchical Masking pre-training (HMP) for the effective representation of hierarchical structures within flat transaction sequences. Pretrained on WeChat Pay data, our model, PTP, demonstrates superior performance in downstream fraud transaction detection, especially in few-shot learning scenarios, showcasing great potential in payment transaction scenarios.},

abstract = {Email is a traditional but still important global communication tool. An email address is a kind of personal identifier, and email addresses printed on publications require persistent reachability. Kyushu University provides a university-wide email service, Primary Mail Service, and assigns a Primary Mail Address for each member. Divisions of the university additionally operate individual email services for their internet subdomains and administer member email addresses. Since email is a major means of cyberattacks nowadays, the secure operation of an email server demands considerable effort and high skill. This article describes a challenge at Kyushu University for consolidating individual email services. Since 2018, the Primary Mail Service has been operated using Microsoft’s cloud service, Exchange Online, which supports multiple internet domains on a tenant. The approach employed is registering divisional subdomains to the tenant and configuring forwarding addresses from addresses of the subdomains to the Primary Mail Addresses or external addresses. A desirable scheme is for each domain administrator to manage forwarding addresses of the domain, but Exchange Online is unable to delegate administration to the domains. To overcome this, a system was designed and developed for domain administrators to create, read, update, and delete forwarding addresses. Beginning in July 2020, a new service to import divisional domains was offered. We are now planning measures for promoting the consolidation of individual email services.},

abstract = {AI-enabled decision support systems have repeatedly failed in real world applications despite the underlying model operating as designed. Often this was because the system was used in an unexpected manner. Our goal is to enable better prediction of how systems will be used prior to their implementation as well as to improve existing designs, by taking human behavior into account. There are several challenges to collecting such data. Not having access to an existing prediction engine requires the simulation of such a system's behavior. This simulation must include not just the behavior of the underlying model but also the context in which the decision will be made in the real world. Additionally, collecting statistically valid samples requires that test subjects make repeated choices under slightly varied conditions. Unfortunately, in such repetitious conditions fatigue can quickly set in. Games provide us the ability to address both of these challenges by providing both systems context and narrative context. Systems context can be used to convey some or all of the information the player needs to make a decision in the game environment itself, which can help avoid the onset of fatigue. Narrative context can provide a broader environment within which the simulated system operates, adding a sense of progress, showing the effect of decisions, adding perceived social norms, and setting incentives and stakes. This broader environment can further prevent player fatigue while replicating many of the external factors that might affect choices in the real world. In this paper we describe the design of the Human-AI Decision Evaluation System (HADES), a test harness capable of interfacing with a game environment, simulating the behavior of an AI-enabled decision support system, and collecting the results of human decision making based upon such a system's predictions. Additionally, we present an analysis of data collected by HADES while interfaced with a visual novel game focused on software cyber-risk assessment.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The last decade has witnessed steadily growing markets for cyber (re-)insurance products to mitigate residual cyber-risk. In this introductory effort, we prove that underwriting simple cyber re-insurance policies can be worst case computationally hard, i.e., NP-Hard, especially for upcoming IoT societies. More specifically, let alone human underwriters, even a computer cannot compute an optimal cyber re-insurance policy in a reasonable amount of time in worst case scenarios. Here, optimality of a contract is judged based on the extent of information asymmetry induced negative externalities it mitigates between a re-insurance seller and a buyer. Our result does not challenge the existence of cyber re-insurance markets that we feel will be a necessity in the IoT age, but only rationalizes why their growth might be slow, and would subsequently need regulatory intervention. As a direct applicability of our methodology, we argue that optimal traditional cyber-insurance underwriting in IoT societies is also NP-Hard.},

abstract = {Insurance premiums reflect expectations about the future losses of each insured. Given the dearth of cyber security loss data, market premiums could shed light on the true magnitude of cyber losses despite noise from factors unrelated to losses. To that end, we extract cyber insurance pricing information from the regulatory filings of 26 insurers. We provide empirical observations on how premiums vary by coverage type, amount, and policyholder type and over time. A method using particle swarm optimisation and the expected value premium principle is introduced to iterate through candidate parameterised distributions with the goal of reducing error in predicting observed prices. We then aggregate the inferred loss models across 6,828 observed prices from all 26 insurers to derive the County Fair Cyber Loss Distribution. We demonstrate its value in decision support by applying it to a theoretical retail firm with annual revenue of $50M. The results suggest that the expected cyber liability loss is $428K and that the firm faces a 2.3\% chance of experiencing a cyber liability loss between $100K and $10M each year. The method and resulting estimates could help organisations better manage cyber risk, regardless of whether they purchase insurance.},

Websites have adopted risk-based authentication, incorporating browser fingerprinting techniques to counteract this threat. However, attackers have adapted by using anti-detect browsers, referred to as fraud browsers, to spoof user information effectively. While traditional fingerprinting methods are capable of identifying fraud browsers, they encounter scalability and performance challenges in risk-based systems. To address these issues, we developed Browser Polygraph, an ML-based tool that applies coarse-grained privacy-preserving fingerprints to assess browser authenticity and assigns risk factors to suspicious sessions. Coarse-grained fingerprints, by design, cannot be used for user tracking but only for fraud detection purposes. Deployed at a major financial company, Browser Polygraph has flagged suspicious sessions, enabling more targeted identification of potential fraud, thus enhancing the company's ability to tackle ATO attempts.},

This type of AI-based cybersecurity attack, targeting at GUI systems, is explored in this paper. It is twofold: (1) A malware is designed to attack the existing GUI system by using AI-based object recognition techniques. (2) Its defensive methods are discovered by generating adversarial examples and other methods to alleviate the threats from the intelligent GUI attack. The results have shown that a generic GUI attack can be implemented and performed in a simple way based on current AI techniques and its countermeasures are temporary but effective to mitigate the threats of GUI attack so far.},

abstract = {Third-party residual cyber-risk management (RCRM) services (e.g., insurance, re-insurance) are getting increasingly popular (currently, a multi-billion-dollar annual market) with C-suites managing industrial control systems (ICSs) based upon IoT-driven cyber-physical IT and OT technology. Apart from mitigating and diversifying losses from (major) cyber-threats RCRM services positively contribute to improved cyber-security as an added societal benefit. However, it is also well known that RCRM markets (RCRM for ICSs being a mere subset) are relatively nascent and sparse. There is a huge (approximately 10-fold) supply-demand gap in an environment where (a) annual cyber-losses range in trillions of USD, and (b) CRM markets (residual or otherwise) are annually worth only up to 0.25 trillion USD. The main reason for this wide gap is the age-old information asymmetry (IA) bottleneck between the demand and supply sides of the third-party RCRM market, which is significantly amplified in modern cyber-space settings. This setting primarily comprises interdependent and intra-networked ICSs (and/or traditional IT systems) from diverse application sectors inter-networked with each other in a service supply-chain environment. In this article, we are the first to prove that optimal cyber-risk diversification (integral to RCRM) under IA is computationally intractable, i.e., NP-hard, for such (systemic) inter-networked societies. Here, the term “optimal diversification” implies the best way a residual and profit-minded cyber-risk manager can form a portfolio of client coverage contracts. We follow this up with the design and analysis of a computational policy that alleviates this intractability challenge for the social good. Here, the social good can be ensured through denser RCRM markets that in principle improve cyber-security. Our work formally establishes (a) the reason why it has been very difficult in practice (without suitable policy intervention) to densify IA-affected RCRM markets despite their high demand in modern CPS/ICS/IoT societies; and (b) the efficacy of our computational policy to mitigate IA issues between the supply and demand sides of an RCRM market in such societies.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan}
