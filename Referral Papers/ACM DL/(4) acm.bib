abstract = {Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated and increasingly prevalent form of cyber fraud that targets businesses and individuals to gain financial benefits and access sensitive data. BEC fraud involves various strategies such as impersonation, account compromise, and social engineering, making them challenging to detect and prevent. Despite numerous solutions developed to combat BEC, the threat continues to evolve. In this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of BEC, categorising its various forms, detection techniques, and countermeasures. The proposed taxonomy seeks to deepen the comprehension of BEC fraud and establish a comprehensive framework for advancing research and practical applications, facilitating the development of more effective defence mechanisms against BEC fraud.},

abstract = {Online banking has been proven to be an effective and convenient way of providing banking services anywhere and has been a necessity since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the Philippines. Alongside this fact, people have been victims of scams involving these online services. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze reports of online banking scams reported on social media using content analysis. The 26 filtered posts are labeled with 27 codes generated, and the top six were discussed. Specifically, scam (88.46\%) was the most common code, followed by phone calls (57.69\%) and impersonation (53.84\%). Benefits, verifying personal information, and social engineering all had 46.15\% occurrences. It is recommended for potential online banking scams to verify with the bank before giving away information, and to raise awareness on the possible technique's scammers use.},

abstract = {Email Phishing is one of the most pervasive social-engineering attack that targets user credentials and personal information. Current defenses often rely on pattern-based rules or signatures to detect phishing emails. These rules have been prone to changes in the content of the email body as they cannot comprehend the semantics of the message. Cybercriminals are using modern generative AI tools to craft phishing messages that can evade current defenses. In this paper, we present PhishEmailLLM a novel system that relies on publicly available LLMs and advanced ML models to accurately detect phishing emails. We highlight the challenges to creating and use such systems and present our solution to overcome these challenges using modern software and cloud architectures. A thorough evaluation of our system was conducted using publicly available high-quality phishing datasets. We evaluated several top of the line freely available LLMs and compared our system to well-known baseline systems for Phishing detection. We established that our meta-hybrid approach, using LLMs and traditional ML algorithms for phishing detection, outperforms other systems and costs less to run.},

Interactions, whether mediated by information and communication technologies or not, have always been necessarily between two spaces. Now, the diametric conflict of those two spaces has become at once obvious and unsettlingly unknown. Interaction has become real and synthetic; informing and deceiving; and clear and cryptic. Sliding between these spaces is uncanny.We raise a challenge for researchers in interaction — face the uncanny. Incorporate it in your design, in your research. And intentionally choose between strengthening the uncanny and mitigating its effects.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to understand what role Information and communications technology (ICT) governance plays in enhancing cyber security in Asia. Assessing the governance of the exploding ICT adoptions and the achievement of ICT educational measures for cyber security is the research agenda.Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the Two-step System Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) method is utilized to investigate ICT governance, the required education, and its relationship to cyber security in 47 Asian countries. Governance is measured using six World Governance Indicators: Government Effectiveness, Control of Corruption, Regulatory Quality, Political Stability, Rule of Law, Voice, and Accountability. Meanwhile, ICT is measured as the average percentage of Internet users, mobile cellular subscribers, fixed broadband, and fixed telephone subscribers.Findings: The study reveals that with the increased usage of ICT quality of Governance improves in Asia. We also observed that the modulating impact of education on ICT has a positive effect on the growth of governance and reduces cyber incidents.Research limitations/implications: The findings have significant implications for the growth of the cyber governance of a country. The study can help the government to design policies for improving the quality of education and harness the potential of ICT for better governance outcomes in Asia.Originality: The role of ICT governance and the interaction between education and cyber security is currently less studied in Asian countries.},

abstract = {Third-party residual cyber-risk management (RCRM) services (e.g., insurance, re-insurance) are getting increasingly popular (currently, a multi-billion-dollar annual market) with C-suites managing industrial control systems (ICSs) based upon IoT-driven cyber-physical IT and OT technology. Apart from mitigating and diversifying losses from (major) cyber-threats RCRM services positively contribute to improved cyber-security as an added societal benefit. However, it is also well known that RCRM markets (RCRM for ICSs being a mere subset) are relatively nascent and sparse. There is a huge (approximately 10-fold) supply-demand gap in an environment where (a) annual cyber-losses range in trillions of USD, and (b) CRM markets (residual or otherwise) are annually worth only up to 0.25 trillion USD. The main reason for this wide gap is the age-old information asymmetry (IA) bottleneck between the demand and supply sides of the third-party RCRM market, which is significantly amplified in modern cyber-space settings. This setting primarily comprises interdependent and intra-networked ICSs (and/or traditional IT systems) from diverse application sectors inter-networked with each other in a service supply-chain environment. In this article, we are the first to prove that optimal cyber-risk diversification (integral to RCRM) under IA is computationally intractable, i.e., NP-hard, for such (systemic) inter-networked societies. Here, the term “optimal diversification” implies the best way a residual and profit-minded cyber-risk manager can form a portfolio of client coverage contracts. We follow this up with the design and analysis of a computational policy that alleviates this intractability challenge for the social good. Here, the social good can be ensured through denser RCRM markets that in principle improve cyber-security. Our work formally establishes (a) the reason why it has been very difficult in practice (without suitable policy intervention) to densify IA-affected RCRM markets despite their high demand in modern CPS/ICS/IoT societies; and (b) the efficacy of our computational policy to mitigate IA issues between the supply and demand sides of an RCRM market in such societies.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan}
