  abstract={In the realm of cybersecurity, Business Email Com-promise attacks have emerged as a significant threat to orga-nizations. This paper introduces a forward-looking approach, the Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism, tailored to confront the challenges of Business Email Compromise prevention. Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism leverages cognitive analysis, artificial intelligence, and automated decision support to discern linguistic nuances and contextual cues within email communications. By doing so, it aims to detect Business Email Compromise threats and enhance users' decision-making capa-bilities, fostering a proactive cybersecurity stance. This paper presents a comprehensive conceptual framework of the Cognitive Email Analysis with Automated Decision Support mechanism, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the landscape of Busi-ness Email Compromise prevention.},
