abstract = {ABSTRACT In the inevitably hi-tech universe of cybercrimes, one of the major still prevailing methods is the usage of the malicious URLs and creating a Phishing link to obtain user credentials from the people. This method is highly subtle and has more effect on people's lives as well as corporate loss. To identify the malicious URLs, the security community has listed blacklists and benign links online. Still, as the technology is being developed day by day, the attackers try to create new phishing URLs using new social engineering methods that could be easily forged into the user's account. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine-learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article addresses the detection of malicious URLs combining the intelligence of both the heuristic-based method and the machine learning process. It has been found that there are many possibilities for detecting zero-day attacks and spear-phishing attacks when incorporating both lexical features and machine learning methods. Out of the six-batch learning process analyzed, we implement a decision tree algorithm in our framework with 99.47\% accuracy during evaluation. The true positive values gained in our proposed hybrid framework is 99.2\% and indicate <1\% of the false-positive values. The implementation shows a precision level higher than the previous model developed and by other antiphishing techniques. A high detection rate on zero-day and spear-phishing attacks and overall results reveal that our system outclasses the current approach to detecting phishing scams.},

abstract = {While antiphishing techniques have evolved over the years, phishing remains one of the most threatening attacks on current network security. This is because phishing exploits one of the weakest links in a network systemâ€”people. The purpose of this research is to predict the possible phishing victims. In this study, we propose the multidimensional phishing susceptibility prediction model (MPSPM) to implement the prediction of user phishing susceptibility. We constructed two types of emails: legitimate emails and phishing emails. We gathered 1105 volunteers to join our experiment by recruiting volunteers. We sent these emails to volunteers and collected their demographic, personality, knowledge experience, security behavior, and cognitive processes by means of a questionnaire. We then applied 7 supervised learning methods to classify these volunteers into two categories using multidimensional features: susceptible and nonsusceptible. The experimental results indicated that some machine learning methods have high accuracy in predicting user phishing susceptibility, with a maximum accuracy rate of 89.04\%. We conclude our study with a discussion of our findings and their future implications.},

abstract = {Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with an equally-threatening scamdemic: a global epidemic of scams and frauds. The unprecedented cybersecurity concerns emerged during the pandemic sparked a torrent of research to investigate cyber-attacks and to propose solutions and countermeasures. Within the scamdemic, phishing was by far the most frequent type of attack. This survey paper reviews, summarises, compares and critically discusses 54 scientific studies and many reports by governmental bodies, security firms and the grey literature that investigated phishing attacks during COVID-19, or that proposed countermeasures against them. Our analysis identifies the main characteristics of the attacks and the main scientific trends for defending against them, thus highlighting current scientific challenges and promising avenues for future research and experimentation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study explores the impact of data breaches on corporate tax planning in the United States. The results reveal that when a firm's headquarter is located in a state that has adopted a data breach notification (DBN) law, there is a significant 3.8\% decrease in the long-term effective tax rate. This reduction translates to annual tax savings of approximately \$8.13 million. Furthermore, tax sheltering is found to decrease by 19.17\% compared to the sample average. These effects are particularly pronounced in financially constrained firms and those operating in high-tech industries. The findings suggest that after the introduction of mandatory data breach disclosure requirements, firms are less inclined to engage in aggressive tax avoidance practices, which could otherwise lead to increased litigation costs. Instead, they prioritize efficient tax planning strategies to improve after-tax cash flows.},

abstract = {Abstract It is a known fact that cybercriminals often manipulate people to steal sensitive information. However, there has been a lack of research in investigating cybercriminals' strategies and the evolution of strategies when crafting phishing emails to entice people to perform a variety of malicious tasks such as clicking on fraudulent links. This study uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), topic modeling, and clustering techniques to analyze and evaluate the persuasive techniques/strategies, which cybercriminals use when crafting fraudulent emails. Our experimental results revealed the efficacy of using these techniques in understanding cybercriminals' mindset as well as how certain aspects of these techniques maintained consistency despite the evolution of the strategy from early Nigerian scams to more modern phishing emails. The findings of our study indicate that the most common technique/strategy used by cybercriminals is a combination of creating a sense of urgency while promising a reward. Moreover, despite the evolution of technology, cybercriminals are still effectively using the same persuasive techniques. Based on our findings, we provided several recommendations to improve anti-phishing software and awareness and training programs.},
