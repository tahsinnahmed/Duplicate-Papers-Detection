abstract = {Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with an equally-threatening scamdemic: a global epidemic of scams and frauds. The unprecedented cybersecurity concerns emerged during the pandemic sparked a torrent of research to investigate cyber-attacks and to propose solutions and countermeasures. Within the scamdemic, phishing was by far the most frequent type of attack. This survey paper reviews, summarises, compares and critically discusses 54 scientific studies and many reports by governmental bodies, security firms and the grey literature that investigated phishing attacks during COVID-19, or that proposed countermeasures against them. Our analysis identifies the main characteristics of the attacks and the main scientific trends for defending against them, thus highlighting current scientific challenges and promising avenues for future research and experimentation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study explores the impact of data breaches on corporate tax planning in the United States. The results reveal that when a firm's headquarter is located in a state that has adopted a data breach notification (DBN) law, there is a significant 3.8\% decrease in the long-term effective tax rate. This reduction translates to annual tax savings of approximately \$8.13 million. Furthermore, tax sheltering is found to decrease by 19.17\% compared to the sample average. These effects are particularly pronounced in financially constrained firms and those operating in high-tech industries. The findings suggest that after the introduction of mandatory data breach disclosure requirements, firms are less inclined to engage in aggressive tax avoidance practices, which could otherwise lead to increased litigation costs. Instead, they prioritize efficient tax planning strategies to improve after-tax cash flows.},

abstract = {Security negligence, a major cause of data breaches, occurs when an organization's information technology management fails to adequately address security vulnerabilities. By conducting a field quasi-experiment using outgoing spam as a focal security issue, this study investigates the effectiveness of reputational sanctions in reducing security negligence in a global context. In the quasi-experiment, a reputational sanction mechanism based on outgoing spam was established for four countries, and for each country, reputational sanctions were imposed on the 10 organizations with the largest outgoing spam volumesâ€”that is, these organizations were listed publicly. We find that because of our reputational sanction mechanism, organizations in the four countries, including those that were not listed, reduced outgoing spam significantly compared to those in similar countries. Within each country, the listed organizations, whose reputations were actually sanctioned, reduced spam to a greater extent than those that were not listed. The spam reduction in the not-listed organizations is mainly driven by increased security awareness, while the reduction in the listed organizations is primarily due to reputation effect. Among the listed organizations, those ranked lower were more responsive to the reputational sanctions. Moreover, we find that reputational sanctions have a stronger effect on large organizations and important organizations that provide network access and transit to others.},
