abstract = {Frequent cyber-attacks compel service providers to employ security-aware service functions (S-SFs) while delivering network services. Typically, one S-SF can be implemented by diverse configurations, each requiring different implementation costs and providing various security levels. These multi-configured S-SFs could compose various security-aware service function chains (S-SFCs) to satisfy the security requirement of an incoming network request. How to properly compose an S-SFC and effectively deploy it remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we discover the “reDundancy security AccumulatioN” (DAN) phenomenon caused by the direct-summation-fashion when calculating the security level (SeL) of an S-SFC and propose a novel methodology to estimate the SeL of one S-SFC for avoiding DAN. To begin, we introduce the concept of security level indicator (SeLI) and our novel methodology. Next, we formulate the problem of security-aware SF selection, chaining, and deployment (Sec-SFCD) with the objective function of cost optimization and prove its NP-hardness. To solve this problem, we propose the security-cost-balance (SCB) factor technique, which measures the average cost of satisfying one unit of security requirement. Based on this technique, we further develop an efficient algorithm called SCB-based S-SFC deployment (SCB-SD) and improves it by proposing the overflowing security level elimination (OSE) technique. Through our thorough analysis, we show the logarithm-approximation of SCB-SD and SCB-SD with OSE technique (SSD-OSE). The extensive simulation results validate SSD-OSE’ s logarithm-approximation and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the benchmarks directly extended from the state-of-the-art by an average of 17.98 % and 67.47 %.}

Cyber-espionage operations are becoming commonplace today and stick to extending a rationale of acquiring information that dates from the very first human conflict.

The information content of cyber breach reports is examined in light of Principle 15 of the 2017 Committee on Sponsoring Organizations Enterprise Risk Management (COSO ERM) information security control framework to understand the degree to which cyber breach reports reflect the established COSO internal control framework. This study utilizes the COSO ERM internal control framework to examine whether current cyber breach reports contain information that may influence a firm’s ability to assess substantial change within its industry due to external forces (COSO ERM Principle 15). As such, this study focuses on data breaches, a special type of cyber incident, which may result in the loss of confidential information. Cyber decision makers rely on this type of information to calibrate information security programs to ensure coverage of relevant threats and the efficient use of available funds. These reports may be used for the purposes of cybersecurity risk assessment and strategic planning. We compare, contrast, and analyzie the reports to identify their utility in such contexts. We also provide an overview of the current cybersecurity reporting environment and suggest revisions to US national cyber policy with the intent of increasing the benefit to reporters and consumers of the data. This study is focused on education as to the current structure of breach reporting based upon our review and synthesis of publicly-available breach reports. In this study, we review nine (9) reports that meet four (4) criteria. We relate these criteria to the framework provided by COSO ERM Principle 15 by analyzing and placing the criteria into a taxonomy developed for this purpose. We analyze the degree to which the reports are complementary, reflect potential improvements of internal controls, and provide recommendations for ways in which these types of reports might be used by practitioners, while highlighting potential limitations. Our findings indicate that the sample reports contain little information that may be incorporated to improve the risk profile of an entity. We provide recommendations to improve the information content and timeliness of breach reports.}

Utilising a qualitative approach guided by the interpretivist paradigm, secondary data from scientific publications, case studies, business journals, and organisational guidelines were analysed. The study identifies significant challenges forensic accountants face, including regulatory inconsistencies and international cooperation barriers. Findings suggest that enhanced international collaboration, the application of advanced forensic techniques, and ethical leadership are essential in detecting such crimes and preventing systemic failures. The study introduces the "Velvet Claw Tactics" framework, which provides insights into these crimes and underscores the role of forensic accountants in understanding and combating them. Recommendations include strengthening global forensic accounting practices and developing a unified international framework to address these crimes effectively. The research contributes to both theoretical and practical advancements in forensic accounting and international cooperation.}

abstract = {Why has the information security law been unsuccessful in having firms in possession of personal data take precautions against data breaches? Why are data breaches becoming more devastating notwithstanding law enforcement? This article seeks an answer from the legal system’s failure to draw a line between agency problems and externalities inherent in the information security market. Although a firm’s misaligned incentive to invest in security measures is basically an agency problem to be addressed by data breach litigation, the U.S. courts’ reluctance to grant Article III standing has reduced potential plaintiffs’ chance of winning and propensity to litigate, impairing the functionality of the private enforcement. As an exception, security vulnerabilities can have the nature of negative externalities to be addressed by the public enforcement, to the extent that those in “key holders” such as payment card processors enable intruders to easily circumvent the security measures taken by other firms in the same security chain, and that those in massive data aggregators undermine public trust in the whole data infrastructure. Government regulations, which need to be targeted at such sources of negative externalities, have actually been misaimed at a few cases arising from conventional agency problems. To test these hypotheses, this article presents an empirical study of security breach notifications filed in California during 2012–2016 and relevant court and government agency records produced until 2018.}

abstract = {In the ever-changing cyber threat landscape, evolving malware threats demand a new technique for their detection. This paper puts forward a strategy for distinguishing malware programs based on transfer learning procedures. The proposed method, known as DTMIC — deep transfer learning for malware image classification, leverages the capabilities of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture previously trained with ImageNet dataset (>10 million images) for malware classification. Window’s portable executable files (PEs) are converted into grayscale images, with the perception that similar malware families fundamentally show the same characteristics when represented as visualized images. Grayscale images serve as input to the customized deep CNN architecture. Features extracted from the convolutional layers of the deep CNN model are flattened and fed into a fully connected dense layer. In addition, to avoid the overfitting problem that many CNN models face, a regularization technique called Early Stopping is employed to monitor the validation loss with configured parameters. The effectiveness and robustness of the model are evaluated on two benchmark datasets — the MalImg dataset (9339 malware samples of 25 families) and the Microsoft BIG dataset (10868 malware samples of 9 families). DTMIC achieved 98.92% test accuracy for MalImg datasets and 93.19% for Microsoft datasets. For comparative analysis, well-established CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Google’s inceptionV3 are implemented, both as a feature extractor and a classifier. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DTMIC method outperforms the selected baseline models and is resilient to packed and encrypted malware. Moreover, this study validates the model’s efficacy on recent and real-world malware samples collected on Honeypots in the wild, with an accuracy of 96.43%.}

While the goal of security communications is the gain compliance, there is still much to learn related to what influences a user to comply. This research explores the effects that (im)politeness has on intention to comply with security directives. The research utilized an experiment that focused on secure browser setting directives using several types of online communication. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive communications/directives that were text-based, text/image-based, or video-based. The communications were also grouped into polite and impolite messaging. The results for the overall model indicated perceived richness had a negative influence on perceived mental workload. Additionally, perceived mental workload resulted in a decreased intention to comply with security directives. There were no significant differences between polite and impolite groups for the treatment groups with text-based and text/image-based messaging. However, in the video-based treatment, the relationship between perceived richness and intention to comply with security directives was significantly different between the polite and impolite groups.}

abstract = {On 19 August 2011, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers adopted Directive C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime at its Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session in Abuja, Nigeria. The adoption of the Directive at that time arose from the need to tackle the growing trend in cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, as some Member States were already gaining global notoriety as major sources of email scams and Internet fraud. Accordingly, the Directive established a legal framework for the control of cybercrime within the ECOWAS region, and also imposed obligations on Member States to establish the necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative measures to tackle cybercrime. In particular, the Directive required Member States to implement those obligations “not later than 1st January, 2014″. This article undertakes an inquiry into the legal status of the Directive as an ECOWAS regional instrument in the domestic legal systems of Member States. In this regard, the article examines whether the requirement regarding the superiority or direct applicability of ECOWAS Community laws such as ECOWAS Acts and Regulations in the domestic legal systems of Member States also apply to ECOWAS Directives such as the Cybercrime Directive. The article also examines the legal implications of the Directive's obligations for Member States. The article argues that while some Member States have not implemented the obligations under the Directive, that those obligations however provide a legal basis for holding Member States accountable, where the failure to implement has encouraged the perpetration of cybercrime that infringed fundamental rights guaranteed under human right instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights or under their national laws.}

The study attempts to reveal the degree of awareness of students of the University of Jordan about electronic crimes related to e-learning and the legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e-learning. Quantitative research methods were used. A questionnaire was established and distributed to students enrolled in the following online courses: Ethics and Human Values, Communication Skills, and National Culture. Analysis of the data revealed that students had a high awareness about cybercrime due to the widespread use of the internet by students as it became an integral part of their daily lives. The degree of awareness of student about legal procedures and penalties related to electronic crimes in e-learning was medium. This indicates students' lack of awareness of the effectiveness of procedures and penalties for electronic crimes that can be applied in e-learning due to the rapid transition in the learning process at the University of Jordan from traditional learning to distance e-learning that was imposed during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings, the study presented a set of recommendations that could be implemented to increase awareness and maximize the benefit of using e-learning.}

At the micro level, a firm's effectiveness of security spending in addressing specific cyber threats can be reduced when other co-dependent security measures are not put in place. The paper derives an optimal mix of cybersecurity investments in “knowledge and expertise” versus “deploying mitigation measures”. The paper proposes customizing cyber insurance for firms with itemized threat-specific coverage with a portion of the premium used to help clients with risk knowledge and nudge clients in implementing risk mitigation measures.

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to help build awareness with financial institutions about the money laundering risks posed by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules and the measures that financial institutions can adopt to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as “Money Mules”.
Design/methodology/approach
The research took the form of a desk study, which analysed various documents and reports such as a 2019 report on Money Mules by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL); a 2019 and 2020 report on Money Mules by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Better Business Bureau (BBB); the Financial Action Task Force Guidance on the Risk Based Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High Level Principles and Procedures) 2007; the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations 2012; the United Kingdom’s Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017; the United States Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 2014; Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2018; The UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part I June 2017 (Amended December 2017); the United States Codified Bank Secrecy Act Regulations (31 CFR); the Nigerian Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 (as amended); and the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part II: Sectoral Guidance June 2017 (Amended December 2017).
Findings
This paper determined that financial institutions may be able to prevent proceeds of crime from being laundered by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules if they focus monitoring resources on the emotionally vulnerable customers like newcomers to the country, unemployed people who may have lost their jobs because of a pandemic like COVID-19, students and those in economic hardship; pay very close attention to the country of origin where the funds emanate from; pay very close attention to the country where the funds are being transferred to; and pay close attention to frequent large cash deposits followed by wire transfers.
Originality/value
While most articles focus on the money laundering risk(s) associated with Money Mules and the measures that individuals can use to ensure that their bank accounts are not used by criminals to launder illicit funds, this paper focuses on the different mechanisms that banks can use to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as “Money Mules”. This paper recommends a proportional approach that balances anti-money laundering measures, financial inclusion and human rights. The mechanisms/measures which have been extensively discussed in this paper will help banks to identify, assess and understand their money laundering and terrorist financing risks as it relates to Money Mules and take commensurate measures to mitigate them.}

Researchers have demonstrated the influence of a person’s environment and exposure to the Internet on their online security behavior (Bosnjak & Brumen, 2016; He et al., 2021; Juozapavičius et al., 2022). Those studies suggest that social identity seems to play a role in password choice. The objective of this study was to determine if the criminal nature of a network influences password-creation strategies. To achieve this, we utilized two databases with a substantial number of actual passwords (1485,095) that had been leaked to the Internet. One database was sourced from a non-delinquent social network, while the other was from a hacker forum. We employed logistic regression to reveal the characteristics associated with each group, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of different types of password strategies and the similarity between actors of the same network. Results show that users of the same network have passwords with characteristics that are similar to each other. Individuals with the same social interests seem more likely to use the same password-creation strategies. From a network analysis perspective, the results show that similar individuals (sharing the same interests) are similar in other aspects (password creation strategies). These findings offer valuable insights into the diverse landscape of password varieties and user behaviors, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of internet user networks.}

The results show that Internet security is a crucial determinant for Chinese firms to make location decisions overseas. Particularly, a secure Internet significantly promotes Chinese outward FDI to a host country. In contrast, Internet security in surrounding countries yields negative spatial location spillovers that hinder Chinese firms from investing in the host country. This phenomenon can be regarded as a national competition for Internet security to attract FDI. Mechanism tests show that Internet security promotes FDI in host countries through four channels: operating cost reductions, transaction cost-cutting, information asymmetry decreases, and confidentiality protection. Further heterogeneous analyses show that the impact of Internet security is more significant as time passes and the host country becomes an Internet society. In contrast, specific international cooperation frameworks led by China weaken the location effect of Internet security for Chinese outward FDI. These results are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and to different specifications. Therefore, the host authorities should endeavor to create a high-quality Internet security environment to attract FDI.}
