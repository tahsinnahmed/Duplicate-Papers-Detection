abstract = {At the heart of IT security is a simple concept – proving you are who you say you are. In this context, ‘you’ might be a human logging into a network or service, a device interacting with an application programming interface (API), one network talking to another or any number of other scenarios. And the proof could be a certificate, an SSH key, a token of some form or our old favourite – and inevitably the artefact we'll be talking most about here – the old, fragile and yet seemingly unkillable password. At the heart of IT security is a simple concept – proving that you are who you say you are. But the ways we have of doing that, through credentials of some form, are flawed. Credential abuse comes in many forms. The question we need to ask is, where does it sit in terms of an organisation's attack surface and security priorities? In the first of a two-part feature, Steve Mansfield-Devine surveys a number of industry experts to get their views on what forms of credential abuse are being encountered and the threat these pose to enterprises.}

Our research aimed to understand the factors influencing SMBs' approach to cybersecurity, their level of threat awareness and the importance placed on cybersecurity. It also explored the extent to which NIST CSF practices are implemented by SMBs while also detecting and ranking the prevalent challenges faced by SMBs. Additionally, resources that SMBs turn to for help and guidance were also evaluated. While the survey-based study was on Western Australian SMBs, the results are of more general and wider interest. Our study found the lack of funds to be the biggest hindrance to cybersecurity, along with a lack of knowledge on where to start implementing good security practices. SMBs also lacked familiarity with relevant regulations and frameworks. The study highlights areas for improvement, such as access control mechanisms, individual user accounts, formalised policies and procedures, and dedicated budgets. SMBs heavily rely on Google search for cybersecurity information, emphasising the need for optimised search results from authoritative sources. IT service providers and informal networks also emerge as important sources of cybersecurity guidance, while local universities could assist SMBs but remain underutilised in this regard. Interestingly, factors such as organisational size, industry sector, and revenue level did not significantly impact SMBs' perception of vulnerability to cyber threats. However, further investigation is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different IT service models for SMBs' cybersecurity needs. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the specific gaps and challenges faced by SMBs in the cybersecurity domain, as well as their preferred methods of seeking and consuming cybersecurity assistance. The findings can guide the development of targeted strategies and policies to enhance the cybersecurity posture of SMBs.}

Although Phishing attacks have been known for more than two decades, and there is ongoing research for developing effective techniques against these attacks, the increasing trend of attacks confirms the lack of robust solutions and techniques against these attacks. According to Trend Micro, over 90 percent of all Cybersecurity attacks begin with spear Phishing emails and hence there is a need for comprehensive research in the area of anti-Phishing to improve the overall Cybersecurity landscape. This paper, therefore, performs a comprehensive study and analysis of past research work in anti-Phishing. The survey also tries to study various relationships such as those between the Phishers and the motives behind Phishing and explores/assesses various tactics that are employed for launching Phishing attacks. Highlighting the role of social and cognitive factors in the success of a Phishing attack which was not focused on in earlier reviews, is one of the major contributions of this work. The paper also provides a detailed understanding of the types of Phishers and the type of Phishing performed by them with a comprehensive classification of anti-Phishing detection/prevention/awareness solutions through a systematic literature review. The contributions of leading organizations and their active role through various anti-Phishing products are also discussed in this paper to bring light to the research and development happening in the industry with respect to anti-Phishing. Finally, the cyber laws to handle Phishing attacks in various countries have been presented for readers’ interest. We believe this survey brings new knowledge and a comprehensive perspective to its readers from academia and industry to explore new horizons for research activities in anti-Phishing.}

Most false emails can be detected, but certain undiscovered ones can be dangerous and compromise security. The attacker compromises SMTP to launch an email spoofing attack. This is not difficult given that it was designed without any security safeguards. Spoofers typically exploit the various fields in email headers. By taking advantage of loopholes in email security systems, attackers can create an ideal spoofing mail. As a result, it appears as a reliable source and succeeds in phishing attempts. An in-depth analysis of the email process, its protocols, and authentication mechanisms along with the security measures and adoption rates that led to a variety of spoofing attacks has been examined in our work. Our experiments on renowned mail service suppliers observed that some of them are still vulnerable to associated flaws. Further, we analyzed how different aspects such as age and education, determine whether or not a message is spoofed, and how malware uses email as a command and control to compromise the victim's device and seize control of it. Further, it offers a multitude of mitigation strategies against spoofing attempts that aid aspirants in future research.}

However, the existing methods to safeguard email communication, including spam, phishing, and ham emails, have exhibited suboptimal classification performance and inadequate security. So, this work introduces the Optimized Email Classification Network (OECNet) to categorize emails and mitigate security risks effectively. Leveraging a hybrid dataset comprising spam, phishing, and ham email information, we perform meticulous preprocessing to ensure data uniformity. Our approach incorporates principal component analysis (PCA) to extract email-specific pattern properties, enhancing feature discernment through eigenvalue analysis. Inspired by natural swarm behaviours, we employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select highly correlated features from PCA outcomes, optimizing the model's efficacy. The OECNet uses PSO-optimised features to integrate a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (DLCNN) model for classification. This novel methodology surpasses traditional methods, yielding an accuracy of 98.43 %, precision of 97.78 %, recall of 96.41 %, and an impressive F1-score of 97.07 %. The proposed OECNet advances email classification technology and establishes a robust security framework against malicious intrusions in global communication. The hybrid dataset incorporates UCI, CSDMC, and SpamAssassin information, ensuring comprehensive coverage and realistic scenarios for effective model training and evaluation.}

We argue that current policy, and subsequently, social scientific (or criminological more specifically) framings, tend to arbitrarily ‘carve up’ the objects of study that interest us, in turn creating a ‘conceptual disorder’ that has implications for how we explain, and respond to, these harmful crimes. This raises questions about the value of the concept of ‘economic crime’ and about the related process of conceptual abstraction. In analytical terms, we argue that more can be gained by focusing on the necessary and contingent relations of serious crimes for economic gain. Second, to scrutinise the logic of ‘economic criminology’ (framed in terms of a singular discipline) and assess the value that criminology can add to analyses of related behaviours. Notwithstanding the journal’s aim to create a sub-field of ‘economic criminology’, we argue that research into the nature, organisation and control of serious crimes for economic gain ought to begin from the perspective of how we can create integrative, collaborative or multi-dimensional accounts of these behaviours in order to better organise, and identify, the most plausible explanations and interventions. To this end, we explore different ways of working interdisciplinarily, considering the underlying logic and/or rationale for doing so.}

In fact, the number of cyber crimes is exponentially growing in a scenario where the global COVID-19 pandemic determined several conditions that have negatively affected companies' cyber-security posture. The adoption of risk management processes can help reduce security threats and mitigate both financial and reputation losses. In computer systems, it is crucial to relate security risks to the system infrastructure. Bayesian attack graph models can help reach such a goal. The approach is very effective as it allows to define the attack paths an attacker would perform against a specific network infrastructure. In this way, it is possible to construct a truthful representation of a company's security risks that cannot be obtained with other approaches. Still, Bayesian risk management approaches are usually based on advanced threats. Namely, those threats relate to vulnerabilities that can only be exploited by a skilled attacker. Although several works enrich the expressiveness of the proposed Bayesian model, current proposals do not provide insights into how it is possible to estimate security control costs, asset values, and threat probabilities for other types of threats. Furthermore, they do not take insider threats into consideration. This work shows that a risk management framework based on Bayesian Attack Graphs can be adapted to include a variety of threats, including those related to the insiders. We first extend an interesting work based on Bayesian Decision Networks to cover a broader range of threats. Then, we formalize several concepts, such as security control coverage and risk strategy, and show that our model can easily integrate insider threats when specific properties are defined. Finally, in order to address insider threats, we enrich the model with security controls that differ from the standard ones, such as technical IT training sessions and employee satisfaction surveys.}

As businesses virtually eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws. Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event, cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The performance of the system has been evaluated against various malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is a viable solution to this problem.}

abstract = {Purpose
Cyberfraud is a global problem, which has negative impacts on the financial institutions, global economy and the public. The existing policy and regulatory frameworks for mitigating cyberfraud in South African banks are not holistic, thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a holistic policy and regulatory framework that integrates the legal, governance, internal control and supervisory frameworks for cyberfraud mitigation in the South African banking industry.
Method
ology: The study employs a mixed method comprising of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. A structured questionnaire was developed and made available to selected members of staff of the 17 licensed banks in South Africa. These experts deal directly with the banking operations, administration and customers' services. Non-parametric statistical analysis, specifically the Chi-square, Fischer's Exact, Spearman's correlation and cross tabulation statistics, were employed for the statistical analysis of the data gathered from the survey. From the outcome of the survey, a simplified policy and regulatory framework was developed for the mitigation of the effects of cyberfraud in order to enhance the performance of South African banks.
Findings
The outcome of the survey indicated that there is a relationship between the methods of cyberfraud identification and the occurrence of cyberfraud in the South African banking industry. Furthermore, the methods of cyberfraud identification were presumed to be effective based on the evidence presented in this study. Despite this, the effect of cyberfraud perpetration was still found to be detrimental to the South African banks.
Practical implications
This study presents a simplified and executable policy as well as regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfaud in South African banks. The proposed policies and regulations are geared towards improving cyber resilience and minimising the effects of cyberfraud occurrences.
Novelty
Existing works have not sufficiently reported on the integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud. Thus, this study developed a simplified integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud to enhance the performance of South African banks in the area of cyberfraud mitigation.}

abstract = {In the ever-changing cyber threat landscape, evolving malware threats demand a new technique for their detection. This paper puts forward a strategy for distinguishing malware programs based on transfer learning procedures. The proposed method, known as DTMIC — deep transfer learning for malware image classification, leverages the capabilities of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture previously trained with ImageNet dataset (>10 million images) for malware classification. Window’s portable executable files (PEs) are converted into grayscale images, with the perception that similar malware families fundamentally show the same characteristics when represented as visualized images. Grayscale images serve as input to the customized deep CNN architecture. Features extracted from the convolutional layers of the deep CNN model are flattened and fed into a fully connected dense layer. In addition, to avoid the overfitting problem that many CNN models face, a regularization technique called Early Stopping is employed to monitor the validation loss with configured parameters. The effectiveness and robustness of the model are evaluated on two benchmark datasets — the MalImg dataset (9339 malware samples of 25 families) and the Microsoft BIG dataset (10868 malware samples of 9 families). DTMIC achieved 98.92% test accuracy for MalImg datasets and 93.19% for Microsoft datasets. For comparative analysis, well-established CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Google’s inceptionV3 are implemented, both as a feature extractor and a classifier. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DTMIC method outperforms the selected baseline models and is resilient to packed and encrypted malware. Moreover, this study validates the model’s efficacy on recent and real-world malware samples collected on Honeypots in the wild, with an accuracy of 96.43%.}

Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated. Third, contrary to the belief that cyber-insurance markets are ineffective, it can guide financial firms to design realistic cyber-insurance products.}

Dangerous spam emails may thus reach the users and then result in damaging attacks spreading through the corporate network. This paper describes a collaborative approach for early detection of malicious spam emails and its application in the context of large companies. By the joint effort of the employees and the security analysts during the last two years, a large dataset of potentially malicious spam emails has been collected with each email being labeled as critical or irrelevant spam. By analyzing the main distinguishing characteristics of dangerous emails, a set of both traditional and novel features was identified and then tested and optimized by applying common supervised machine learning classifiers. The obtained massive experimental results show that Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers achieve the best performance, with the optimized feature set of only 36 features achieving 91.6% Recall and 95.2% Precision. These results, confirmed by a large empirical experiment conducted on 40,000+ company employees, led to the re-engineering of the email threat management process to ensure a high level of security in the company, as well as an increased security awareness of all company employees.}

abstract = {Purpose
Phishing is one of the major threats affecting businesses worldwide in current times. Organizations and customers face the hazards arising out of phishing attacks because of anonymous access to vulnerable details. Such attacks often result in substantial financial losses. Thus, there is a need for effective intrusion detection techniques to identify and possibly nullify the effects of phishing. Classifying phishing and non-phishing web content is a critical task in information security protocols, and full-proof mechanisms have yet to be implemented in practice. The purpose of the current study is to present an ensemble machine learning model for classifying phishing websites.
Design/methodology/approach
A publicly available data set comprising 10,068 instances of phishing and legitimate websites was used to build the classifier model. Feature extraction was performed by deploying a group of methods, and relevant features extracted were used for building the model. A twofold ensemble learner was developed by integrating results from random forest (RF) classifier, fed into a feedforward neural network (NN). Performance of the ensemble classifier was validated using k-fold cross-validation. The twofold ensemble learner was implemented as a user-friendly, interactive decision support system for classifying websites as phishing or legitimate ones.
Findings
Experimental simulations were performed to access and compare the performance of the ensemble classifiers. The statistical tests estimated that RF_NN model gave superior performance with an accuracy of 93.41 per cent and minimal mean squared error of 0.000026.
Research limitations/implications
The research data set used in this study is publically available and easy to analyze. Comparative analysis with other real-time data sets of recent origin must be performed to ensure generalization of the model against various security breaches. Different variants of phishing threats must be detected rather than focusing particularly toward phishing website detection.
Originality/value
The twofold ensemble model is not applied for classification of phishing websites in any previous studies as per the knowledge of authors.}

abstract = {This study analyzed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis from the angle of cyber-crime,highlighting the wide spectrum of cyberattacks that occurred around the world. The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13%; emails with 13%; followed by malicious domains with 9%. Mobile apps followed with 8%, Phishing was 7%, Malware 7%, Browsing apps with 6%, DDoS has 6%, Website apps with 6%, and MSMM with 6%. BEC frequency was 4%, Ransomware with 2%, Botnet scored 2% and APT recorded 1%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study's findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks.}

The medium is the platform which the approaches reside and the vector is the means of propagation utilised by the phisher to deploy the attack. The paper focuses primarily on the detailed discussion of these approaches. The combination of these approaches that the phishers utilised in conducting their phishing attacks is also discussed. This review will give a better understanding of the characteristics of the existing phishing techniques which then acts as a stepping stone to the development of a holistic anti-phishing system. This review creates awareness of these phishing techniques and encourages the practice of phishing prevention among the readers. Furthermore, this review will gear the research direction through the types of phishing, while also allowing the identification of areas where the anti-phishing effort is lacking.

This article seeks to provide a broader organizational understanding of cyber-resilience and the tensions associated with its implementation. We apply Weick's (1995) sensemaking framework to examine four foundational tensions of cyber-resilience: a definitional tension, an environmental tension, an internal tension, and a regulatory tension. We then document how these tensions are embedded in cyber-resilience practices at the preparatory, response and adaptive stages. We rely on qualitative data from a sample of 58 cybersecurity professionals to uncover these tensions and how they reverberate across cyber-resilience practices.}

We highlight the need to address human errors, social engineering attacks, and insider threats while distinguishing how differences in infrastructure, intelligence, and citizen roles between smart and cognitive cities shape the management of human-centric vulnerabilities. Our review of existing research on integrating human behavioral data into AI systems suggests significant threat detection and response improvements. The findings suggest that human-centric AI detection tools not only mitigate risks of human errors and latent failures but also significantly improve protection for vulnerable populations, thereby promoting stronger human-AI collaboration. Ultimately, this paper advocates for advancing these tools to bolster urban cybersecurity frameworks.}

A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyze existing Pharma 4.0 frameworks. The examined frameworks were categorized into Manufacturing and Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, Clinical Trials and R&D Digitalization, Workforce Competence, and Pharma 5.0. Analysis of the identified frameworks reveals that while they offer strategies for digital transformation, they focus solely on specific areas. In response, a conceptual Pharma 4.0 framework is proposed, emphasizing organizational readiness assessment, core technology integration, cybersecurity and data management, system integration, and continuous improvement. This framework provides a practical roadmap for Pharma 4.0 adoption, improving regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. Also, the framework supports a diverse range of pharmaceutical organizations, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Africa and other developing nations.

Using the literature as a backdrop, we identify and conceptualize a thematic dimensional framework of fraudulent phishing attacks. This study uses benchmark datasets of fraudulent email to empirically validate the proposed dimensional framework. Specifically, a combination of machine learning-based content analysis and topic modeling found a majority of the discovered topics were labeled against the proposed dimensions. Statistical analysis was employed to provide empirical evidence of the thematic dimensions of fraudulent email attacks. This study thus, not only extends the cybersecurity literature by identifying and validating eight dimensions that enrich our understanding of phishing and attack identification but stimulates cumulative research endeavors to develop yet more comprehensive dimensional frameworks of phishing email attacks.}

They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into “The Good” (beneficial LLM applications), “The Bad” (offensive applications), and “The Ugly” (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.}

abstract = {Investigating the cybersecurity threat landscape is important as it increases situational awareness and defensive agility. Therefore, in this study the cybersecurity threat landscape for Botswana was investigated from the perspective of Information Technology (IT) and Cybersecurity professionals in Botswana. Since Botswana has no publicized empirical data on cyber threats, a cybersecurity incidences dataset from the United Kingdom (UK) was first analyzed to understand cybersecurity trends there. Insights obtained from the UK dataset were used as a baseline to design a questionnaire which was sent out to 31 participants from 20 organizations in Botswana. The findings obtained from the questionnaire were analyzed and compared to findings from the UK. This work showed that a coordinated response to cybersecurity and collection of information related to threats and mitigations can help improve situational awareness and defensive agility.}

abstract = {In this paper, the Search & Heuristic Rule & Logistic Regression (SHLR) combination detection method is proposed for detecting the obfuscation techniques commonly used by phishing websites and improving the filtering efficiency of legitimate webpages. The method is composed of three steps. First, the title tag content of the webpage is input as search keywords to the Baidu search engine, and the webpage is considered legal if the webpage domain matches the domain name of any of the top-10 search results; otherwise, further evaluation is performed. Second, if the webpage cannot be identified as legal, then the webpage is further examined to determine whether it is a phishing page based on the heuristic rules defined by the character features. The first two steps can quickly filter webpages to meet the needs of real-time detection. Finally, a logistic regression classifier is used to assess the remaining pages to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of the detection method. The experimental results show that the SHLR can filter 61.9% of legitimate webpages and identify 22.9% of phishing webpages based on uniform/universal resource locator (URL) lexical information. The accuracy of the SHLR is 98.9%; thus, its phishing detection performance is high.}
